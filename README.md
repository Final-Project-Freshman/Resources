# Resources

The `sample memos.py` has imported the strings of memos and vendors from the `Sample memos - memos.csv`. 

* `memos_list` : a list of strings of memos
* `vendors_list`: a list of vendor names
* `memo_to_vendor_dict`: a hash table (dictionary) that maps each memo string to corresponding vendor

To use this Python file:
1. Clone this entire Resources folder using `git clone https://github.com/Final-Project-Freshman/Resources.git`
2. Put the codes in the file `sample memos.py` and calls the lists and/or dictionary.
Voila!
